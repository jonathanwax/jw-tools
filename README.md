## Welcome to JW Tools

This is a list of tools and links I find useful.

### Learning

I try to learn something new EVERY DAY.

- [Angular2 book by rangle.io](https://angular-2-training-book.rangle.io/): Great book, up-to-date.

- [Redux without Profanity](https://tonyhb.gitbooks.io/redux-without-profanity/content/index.html): Learn React, Redux of BOTH.

### Libraries

Libraries I use when developing software.

- [Normalizr](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr): Make nested JSON Flat, great for Redux.

### Editors

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Open Source, OSX, Windows, Linux, Light with a huge set of extensions.
