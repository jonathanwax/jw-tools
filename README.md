## Welcome to JW Tools

This is a list of tools and links I find useful.

### Libraries

Libraries I use when developing software.

- [Normalizr](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr): Make nested JSON Flat, great for Redux.

### Editors

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Open Source, OSX, Windows, Linux, Light with a huge set of extensions.
